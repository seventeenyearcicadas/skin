# skin 

Our project was developed on the basis of the original VGG16 ConvNet model supported by Keras and we modified it to suit our own problem. In the program code file, we have uploaded four parts:model build.py; saved model; service.py, and Android project development. The log file of our project is also uploaded.

In addition, the raw data has also been uploaded which has been split into training data and test data. 

We have uploaded a video showing the program working and how the user interacting with the application as well as a brief user guide as follows: The user can upload an acne/eczema/psoriasis/ healthy skin picture chosen from the local album by calling the storage permissions and then received the results identified by the model in the server. The results sent from the server will be shown on the screen of the mobile phone.
